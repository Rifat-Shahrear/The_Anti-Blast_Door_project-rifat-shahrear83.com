            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p style="text-align: justified">
                Welcome to the project on designing and analyzing an anti-blast door. The whole blast-protecting door consists of two parts. One is the Frame and the other is the Door. The frame which will be attached to the RCC wall, is made of 4 parts. The E-32 material has been considered for the frame. The overall dimension of the frame is 2092 mm × 3216 mm × 547 mm. On the other hand, the door is also comprised of four parts. The main feature of the door is the square structure honeycomb section which is basically the RCC slabs, oriented in such a way that it demonstrates the honeycomb. The door has two revolute hinges which allow the rotation of the door along a particular axis with respect to the frame. The door has been designed to withstand 
sufficient tensile load and nine door lock rods connected to the locking mechanism have been 
considered to be used to support the shear load. The door locking mechanism can be controlled 
by the door wheel.

            <p style="text-align: justified">
                 An explosion charge is located about 15 meters from the new construction, with the possibility 
of detonation of 150 kg TNT equivalent. </br>
In favor of safety in the calculations, an increase of 20% of the weight of the charge is taken 
into account. Therefore, we have: W=150 × 1.2=180 kg TNT equivalent </br> 
Using CONWEP software or UFC 3-340-02 graphs, the following explosion parameters are 
obtained on the exposed face: </br>
<center>P<sub>max</sub> = 4.6 bar;<br></center>   
<center>T<sub>d</sub> = 14 ms;<br></center>  
<center>Peak Impulse = 14.61 bar-ms;<br></center> 
<center>Impulse, I = 16x2 = 32 bar-ms (for safety)</center>

            <h2>Computation Study (Finite Element Analysis)</h2>
            <p style="text-align: justified">
                The structural behavior of the door and frame has been predicted via simulation software 
Ansys workbench 2021R2. The maximum stress, maximum shear stress, and FOS (Factor of 
Safety) has been evaluated during the numerical simulation. <br>
<b>Assumption</b><br>
1. The inertia effect and the damping effect have been ignored<br>
2. The large deflection has been considered<br>
3. The material nonlinearity has not been considered<br>
4. The nonlinear relationship of pressure with respect to time has been reconfigured in linear 
form <br>
5. Some body parts have been suppressed for physics which seems unnecessary or does not 
have significance. This results in lowering the computation duty which causes a decrease in the 
computational run-time <br>
6. The simulation has been observed during the fully locked situation of the door

4. The pressure profile with respect to time is given below <br>

<li>The maximum equivalent instantaneous stress was observed at almost 297.87 MPa due 
to the 32 bar-ms peak impulse when exerted directly on the door which is below the 
minimum yield strength of the door material E-32 (Yield Strength = 315 MPa). The 
maximum stress was generated near the hole which possesses the door wheel. The 
maximum equivalent stress during pressure rebound was found 94.32 MPa which 
is sufficiently well below the minimum yield strength of the material</li>

<li>The maximum shear stress was found at 160.25 MPa due to the peak impulse which was 
below the yield strength of shear (S<sub>Sy</sub> = 0.577S<sub>y</sub> = 182 MPa). In this case, also the 
maximum shear stress was generated at the circular hole that possesses the door 
wheel</li>

<li>The door lock bar experiences the maximum equivalent stress of 45.187 MPa which 
resulted in a 7 times factor of safety (yield strength (S<sub>y</sub> = 315 MPa) ÷ the equivalent 
stress). That means the bar can take 7 times more stress without any yielding. The 
maximum shear stress on the lock bar during the peak impulse was 25.058 MPa which 
resulted in a 7.25 times safety factor (shear yield strength (S<sub>Sy</sub> = 182 MPa) ÷ the 
equivalent stress). So, the possibility of shear failure of the lock bar is much lower</li>

Since the maximum stresses in the worst-case scenario didn’t exceed the yielding limit of the 
material in any case. So, the possibility of sustaining the door in case of direct exposure at the 
originating point of the explosion with a 32 bar-ms peak impulse is sufficiently high.
<li>The average factor of safety of the door at the peak impulse was 6.45 and the maximum safety 
factor was found 15 times. Moreover, in any circumstance, the factor of safety is always at least 
greater than 1.1. However, the maximum stress of 297.87 MPa is so large for the concrete parts. 
That’s why the Reinforced Concrete Cement slabs have been used in the honeycomb 
considering the counteract with damage of the concrete parts</li>
